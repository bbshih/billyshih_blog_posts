<em>The internet is my home and I like making my home a better place. </em>

My first website I made from scratch was about the pending release of the Nintento 64. Ever since then, I've been hooked to technology surrounding the internet.

After graduating with a business degree at the University of Washington, I enjoyed a career in online marketing at <a href="http://www.webtrends.com">Webtrends</a> helping clients like The Weather Channel, Microsoft and VMWare drive sales through their websites. With 3 years of experience under my belt, I moved onto product development at a <a href="http://www.realself.com">Seattle start-up</a>.

It wasn't the perfect fit for me, so I quit to find a new path and lately have ventured into eCommerce by co-founding <a href="http://www.tplusjdesigns.com">t+j Designs</a>.

My passion comes back to technology though and so I spent the last year learning iOS development and released an app dedicated to my dog, Odin.  My first iPhone app, <a title="Corgi Fetch iPhone app" href="http://corgifetch.billyshih.com">Corgi Fetch</a>, was released in September. Right now, I'm a part of <a href="http://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>, a 2 month Ruby on Rails Bootcamp.

Lastly, giving back is one of my core values, so I have volunteered hundreds of hours as the Chief Marketing Officer and co-founder of <a href="http://sea.philanthroproductions.org">Philanthro Seattle</a>.
