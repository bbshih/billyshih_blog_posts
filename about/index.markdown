<em>The internet is my home and I like making my home a better place.</em>

My first website I made from scratch was about the pending release of the Nintento 64 on a webhost called AngelFire. Ever since then, I've been hooked to technology surrounding the internet.

I've blogged for <a href="http://ecogeek.org">EcoGeek</a>, one of the largest green tech blogs at the time, while I studied business at the University of Washington. Not wanting to go the traditional consulting route with my degree, I interned and later worked full time at a tech start-up doing online marketing helping clients like The Weather Channel, Microsoft and VMWare drive sales through their websites. With 3 years of experience under my belt, I moved onto product development at a <a href="http://www.realself.com">RealSelf</a>, a start-up with explosive growth, getting awarded Inc. 500 status in 2012.

It wasn't the perfect fit for me, so I quit, diving into growing my eCommerce business, <a href="http://www.tplusjdesigns.com">t+j Designs</a> and learning iOS development. I released an app dedicated to my dog, Odin, called <a title="Corgi Fetch iPhone app" href="http://corgifetch.billyshih.com">Corgi Fetch</a>.

Now I'm in <a href="http://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a> dev bootcamp, learning how to sling Ruby on Rails and looking to join a start-up once I'm done in June.

Outside of my career, giving back is one of my core values, so I have volunteered hundreds of hours as the former Chief Marketing Officer and co-founder of <a href="http://sea.philanthroproductions.org">Philanthro Seattle</a>. I'm also a practicioner of <a href="http://www.dhamma.org">Vipassana meditation</a>, read as much as I can, enjoy listening to EDM and am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism">herbivore</a>.
