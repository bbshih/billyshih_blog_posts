<p>My blog has been sparse because I've spent the last few months contracting and applying for iOS dev jobs. Although I eventually found a promising job as an iOS developer, I decided to joinÂ <a href="http://codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>, a developer bootcamp at <a href="http://www.founderscoop.com/">Founder's Co-op</a> in Seattle to teach me some Ruby on Rails, network with the Seattle start-up community and find a opportunity that fits me better. Classes started this month and I'll be done by the end of June. Hopefully by then I'll have a great job as a full time developer.</p>

<p>Look out for more posts about my adventures learning Rails and mobile development, as well as my transition into a new career. Also, I should have fun side projects to talk about.</p>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:bbshih@gmail.com">reach out to me</a> if you have any questions or are interested in hiring a developer!</p>
