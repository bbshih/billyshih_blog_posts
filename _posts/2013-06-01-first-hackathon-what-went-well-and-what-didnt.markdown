[Code for Seattle](http://codeforseattle.org/), a hackathon merging civic engagement and technology was today. It was part of a larger event across the nation called [Hack for Change](http://hackforchange.org/) organized by [Code for America](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/). I had a great time, although I didn't do any coding. 

On reflection, I would do some things differently, so here's a quick summary of my experience and what I learned.

## The Good

 - Met other front-end and back-end developers and designers
 - Learned about non-business problems that technology can help solve
 - Contributed to helping to save cats!
 - Watched someone who really knows Ruby on Rails do some coding
 - Recognized that I have some practical problem solving skills that others lack
 - Finally went to a hackathon :)

## The Bad

 - Only talked to people within my group
 - Didn't get to code because we had enough back and front-end developers and...
 - Our team got stuck with a technical issue that even the people who created the API we were using couldn't help us with

## Takeaways
 - Join a team that is lacking the skills you have
 - Take time to talk to others
 - Be more aggressive in seeking guidance from others around you 
 - If someone has deep knowledge in something you want to know, ask to follow along but still try to be helpful
 - Spend time thinking hard about what you want to do and what you want to accomplish beforehand, even if you change your mind at the event

Overall, it was a fun event and I definitely will join another hackathon ASAP. I'm also planning to go to the [Seattle on Rails Practice meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Seattle-Ruby-on-Rails-Developers-Meetup-Group/events/120095582/) that one of my group members run. More networking and hacking to go along with my regular learning is definitely a big goal of mine, especially after how this event went.

Lastly, giving back is really important to me and this is a unique way for me to give back to the community. I'll definitely try to brainstorm more ways I
can use the awesome data Seattle offers to help others out. I always think about how [OneBusAway](http://onebusaway.org/) made bussing part of my routine and something much less scary when I first started and want to have the same impact on others.

If you know of any events in Seattle, let me know [(@tobillys)](http://www.twitter.com/tobillys) and I'll try my best to go!
